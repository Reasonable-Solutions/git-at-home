* todo stuff
Thins i would like to have on top of this:

somehow Hakari is broken here. cant cargo hakari generate

A repo controller that manages typical git metadata such as latest commit, HEAD, branches, Pull Requests, Merges etc (or several controllers).  (I'll build this eventually)

A service for git-ssh with a little managment api on top. (I'll build this next)

ReadWriteMany enabled PVCs so every single builder can share exactly the same nix store. (We get this on gke auto-pilot :upside_melt: )

a git-person controller that can sync github pubkeys into the repos based on something or other

A handsucked cache implementation

Very large nodes with a I-am-a-build-machine taint or a dedicated node pool

A service for nix-serve with a managemenet api on top. No biggie to build
